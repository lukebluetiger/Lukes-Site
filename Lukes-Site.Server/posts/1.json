Functional programming is like poetry for computers—each function is a verse, each pattern match a rhyme. Yet somehow, this beautiful paradigm remains underappreciated in a world dominated by imperative programming. Let's explore why OCaml, one of the most elegant functional languages, makes me see programming in a completely different light."

Perhaps because it requires a different way of thinking—one that prioritizes immutability, recursion, and pattern matching over loops and state changes. But as systems become more complex and parallelism becomes more important, the clarity and correctness guarantees of functional programming become increasingly valuable. OCaml proves that there's poetry in programming, if only we look for it in the right places."
