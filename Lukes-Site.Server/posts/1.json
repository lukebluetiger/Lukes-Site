Functional programming is like poetry for computers—each function is a verse, each pattern match a rhyme. Yet somehow, this beautiful paradigm remains underappreciated in a world dominated by imperative programming. Let's explore why OCaml, one of the most elegant functional languages, makes me see programming in a completely different light."

OCaml proves that there's poetry in programming, if only we look for it in the right places."
